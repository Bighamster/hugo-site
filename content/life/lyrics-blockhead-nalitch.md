<pre>
You've got a smile too lucky,
Unrestrained malevolent.
Baby you know I like you,
Want you to be my friend.

Nobody likes me,
Nobody wants me -
Stop this insanity!
Curse on my poor blockhead -
Lost opportunity

I belonga to you no longa,
You no longa belonga to me.
Baby you know that I'm growing stronger,
Strong as no one can be.

Nobody likes me,
Nobody wants me -
Stop this insanity!
Curse on my poor blockhead -
Lost opportunity.
</pre>
