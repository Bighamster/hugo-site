    <pre>
      Through dark and light I fight to be
      So close - Shadows and lies mask you from me
      So close - Bath my skin, the darkness within
      So close - The war of our lives no one can win

      The missing piece I yearn to find
      So close - Please clear the anguish from my mind
      So close - But when truth of you comes clear
      So close - I wish my life had never come here

      Through dark and light I fight to be
      So close - Shadows and lies mask you from me
    </pre>
