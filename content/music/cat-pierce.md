      [Verse]
      The moon follows me home, I'm never alone
      It hangs like the shine in my sweet baby's eye
      Sings to me nightly, sings to me brightly
      Tells me the secrets of the sky
      (Mmmm)
      Lips burrow so deep, give me good sleep
      Pour a little sugar on my wound
      Musical master, play harder and faster
      Spinning me up in your silky cocoon
      (Mmmm)

      [Chorus]
      Feels like we're dreaming, we're tripping and reeling
      Just say that you belong to me (You belong to me)
      I could get lost in the feelings we're feeling
      Just say that you belong to me (You belong to me)
      Do you want more of this? Isn't it glorious?
      I can't believe that it's free (You belong to me)
      I will adore you, I'll only live for you
      Just say that you belong to me

      [Verse]
      Crawl into my heart, take me apart
      Do what you please to me, I won't resist
      Find what you're seeking, I am not leaving
      'Til I am drunk, loved up, bitten, and kissed
      I've heard allegations 'bout your reputation
      I'll show you my shadows if you show yours
      Let's get it right dear, give a good fight dear
      We'll keep it all up behind closed doors

      [Chorus]
      Feels like we're dreaming, we're tripping and reeling
      Just say that you belong to me (You belong to me)
      I could get lost in the feelings we're feeling
      Just say that you belong to me (You belong to me)
      Do you want more of this? Isn't it glorious?
      I can't believe that it's free (You belong to me)
      I will adore you, I'll only live for you
      Just say that you belong to me

      [Bridge]
      I must confess to you, I want to possess you
      Feels like we're dreaming, we're tripping and reeling
      Just say that you belong to me
      I could get lost in the feelings we're feeling
      Just say that you belong to me

      [Chorus]
      Feels like we're dreaming, we're tripping and reeling
      Just say that you belong to me (You belong to me)
      I could get lost in the feelings we're feeling
      Just say that you belong to me (You belong to me)
      Do you want more of this? Isn't it glorious?
      I can't believe that it's free (You belong to me)
      I will adore you, I'll only live for you
      Just say that you belong to me

      (Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Ohhhh-oh
      Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Ohhhh-oh
      Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Ohhhh-oh.)
